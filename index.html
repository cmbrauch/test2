<body>
  <br><p>Welcome! I'm excited to hear about your interest into the world of Computer Programming. At first glance, 
    the amount of different coding languages and information available can be quite daunting. But have no fear! 
    I will be offering you different explanations of a few different languages, and then I will ask you a few 
    questions which will make it a little easier in deciding which is best for you.</p>
    <div class="div1">
    <div>
        <li><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ruby_(programming_language)">Ruby</a> is a dynamic, open source programming language with a focus on simplicity and productivity. It has an elegant 
        syntax that is natural to read and easy to write.</li>
    </div><br>
    <div>
        <li><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C_Sharp_(programming_language)">C#</a> is a hybrid of C and C++, it is a Microsoft programming language developed to compete with Sun's Java language. 
        C# is an object-oriented programming language used with XML-based Web services on the . NET platform and designed 
        for improving productivity in the development of Web applications.</li>
    </div><br>
    <div>
        <li><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JavaScript">JavaScript</a> is a dynamic computer programming language. It is lightweight and most commonly used as a part of web 
        pages, whose implementations allow client-side script to interact with the user and make dynamic pages. It is an 
        interpreted programming language with object-oriented capabilities.</li>
    </div><br>
    <div>
    <li><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Go!_(programming_language)">Go</a> is a statically typed, compiled programming language designed at Google. It is syntactically similar to C, but 
    with memory safety, garbage collection, structural typing, and CSP-style concurrency.</li>
    </div><br>
    <div>
    <li><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Python_(programming_language)">Python</a> is an interpreted, high-level, general-purpose programming language. First released in 1991, Python's design 
    philosophy emphasizes code readability with its notable use of significant whitespace.</li>
    </div><br>
    <div>
    <li><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rust_(programming_language)">Rust</a> is a multi-paradigm programming language focused on performance and safety, especially safe concurrency. Rust is 
    syntactically similar to C++, but provides memory safety without using garbage collection.</li>
    </div><br>
    <div>
    <li><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Swift_(programming_language)">Swift</a> is a general-purpose, multi-paradigm, compiled programming language developed by Apple Inc. for iOS, iPadOS, 
    macOS, watchOS, tvOS, and Linux. Swift is designed to work with Apple's Cocoa and Cocoa Touch frameworks and the large 
    body of existing Objective-C code written for Apple products.</li>

    <div class="div2">
    <p>While this might all seem a little overwhelming, I have good news! It ties back to the founding father of coding, Herbie Hancock.
        Herbie created the first THREE computer languages, but in trying to teach others, learned that it was overwhelming for the user 
        to decide which was preferred. So, he enlisted the help of psychologist-extraordinairre, Good Will Hunting, to devise a simple 
        yet efficient way to help in programming language selction! This is a modern-day version, of course.</p>
